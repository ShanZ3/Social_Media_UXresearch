Music APPs User Experience Research
============================
By Shan Zhong <br>
For 2020 Winter DH199 Directed Research. <br>
Instructor: Sookyung Cho

### Tentative Schedule
#### Week 1: Project plannning and setup
> Complete IRB training and get certificate <br>
> Set up a complete time schedule for this directed research <br>

#### Week 2: Refine the research question and design problem statement
> List Music Apps <br>
>* Netease Music:<br> <br>
What differentiates NetEase Music from other apps is its stronger focus on indie artists, enabling it to compete with internet giants like Tencent and Alibaba. Besides short videos, the app has social features that enable users to interact with performers which have profiles on the service. It also has a music streaming option for joggers called Run FM (跑步FM) that selects music with a BPM rate that matches the listener’s running tempo. Aside from music, users can listen to podcasts and watch videos.<br>
With 62.7 million MAU, NetEase is the first music service Unicorn securing RMB 750 million in Series A financing in April 2017.<br> <br>
>* QQ Music:<br> <br>
QQ is Tencent’s very first social product. It started out as an instant messaging tool back in 1998. Although QQ Music shares some  same features as Kugou, such as radio, KTV, and live streaming. It caters to a more urban crowd. QQ Music also offers articles and enables users to watch music videos, concerts, and interviews with famous musicians, including international stars such as Linkin Park.<br>
The app has 211.43 million users. It owes its success to Tencent’s huge presence in the Chinese market, including WeChat. This enabled the service to strike deals with major record labels and allow its users to buy concert tickets through its payment service.<br> <br>
>* Apple Musics:<br> <br>
Apple Music is Apple's streaming music service, comparable to other similar streaming services like Spotify, Amazon Music Unlimited, Google Play Music, Tidal, and others.<br>
Apple Music boasts access to a total of 60 million songs. Content can be streamed or downloaded for offline play, and there are also song and genre-based radio stations available along with the curated Beats 1 radio station. <br> <br>
>* Spotify <br> <br>
Spotify is a new digital music service that enables users to remotely source millions of different songs on various record labels from a laptop, smartphone or other device. This subscription-based service has been available in some countries since 2008. It can run on a Windows, Macintosh or Linux operating system, and is supported by iPhone, Android and Blackberry devices.<br>
One of the main features of Spotify is the ability to share music with others. Spotify users can send music via social media platforms or through email, although some types of music sharing require the recipient to be a Spotify member.<br>
Spotify also addresses the limitations of lack of access to Wi-Fi services through its offline mode provision. Depending on the user’s account type and other factors, Spotify can sync certain amounts of music, in playlists, to a device so that even when the user is disconnected or offline, he or she will be able to hear those selected songs. This and other exclusive features make Spotify a unique service in the very new field of subscription-based digital music hosting.<br> <br>

> Problem statement: <br>
>* The goal of this project is to investigate and compare the representative music apps that shapes the current social life.
As music apps reveals pros and cons in the various contexts of use, it is meaningful and timely to examine the usage patterns of music apps platforms. For example, sharing user-generated-contents also opens the possibility to the invasion of privacy; Connecting to the community sometimes forces users on the agreements that accompany the features unnecessary. I would like to research on the music apps features that users can feel manageable and helpful. As the methods, I will practice a participatory design process by the user research on the preference and usage patterns (frequency), persona & scenario, prototyping and usability testing. The final outcome will include the interactive prototypes published via web documentation and the research paper to elaborate on the process, methods and the findings.

#### Week 6: Persona + Scenarios + Wireflow
##### Persona 
> ![Persona1](https://github.com/ShanZ3/UX-Research-2020/blob/master/persona1.png)
> ![Persona2](https://github.com/ShanZ3/UX-Research-2020/blob/master/Persona2.png)

##### Scenarios
> Scenario 1: <br>
>* Ariel leaves her apartment at 8:00 am to catch the bruin bus to school. On the bus, she takes out her phone and starts her morning routine of listening to music whilst catching up on her social media. She hears a song that has been reposted by her friend on Spotify and saves it to her playlist. Intrigued by the song she wants to read its lyrics but finds no words listed. Frustrated by this, she opens google, inputs the song name followed by “dance music” and “Korean”. The first result shows the lyrics she wanted to read. She clicks the link which opens YouTube on the Songs page. She then likes it and shares it on Facebook. She spends the next 15 minutes of her journey listening to this new song and other recommendations made by Spotify before getting off the bus for a short walk to school.  <br>

> Scenario 2: <br>
>* Stephanie turns off her alarm and finally decides to get up. However, she doesn’t want to leave her bed even if it’s already 10:00 am. Her classes usually start in the afternoon, so she is never in a rush. Sitting on her bed, she grabs her phone out and continues watching music videos she left over last night on YouTube. While she is enjoying her favorite band’s show, Ads on various topics starts interrupt her video, which makes her feel annoyed. She is then forced to watch these ads from beginning to the end while her song is at its chorus. She really wants to upgrade to premium to eliminate the occurrence of these annoying ads. She then clicks the upgrade button and lands on subscription purchase page. Not until she saw the price did she give up this purchase since she believe it does not worth her money. She spends the next 30 minutes to her favorite songs before getting off her bed.
